# Fall2020_Research

This is my research project as part of my Columbia University Master's in Economics Program. The goal of my research paper is to answer the question: Is night light a reliable indicator for economic growth in India. Night-light data provides a numerical measure of brightness of the earth during the night, which is a direct result of human activities. It holds a lot of potential in economic analysis since there is relatively less noise compared to traditional data collection techniques. There are drawbacks when using light night for economic analysis and a section of my paper will focus on the shortcomings of using it for analysis.
